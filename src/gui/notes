expose public drawing API (ie DrawManager class) that allows different entities
(i.e. Monitoring, TE) to color the topology. Entities do that by overwriting the
QItem's draw() functions, and the DrawManager decides which one accesses the graph.
Like kmz overlays, the topology is there but allows other objects to overlay 
it with different color overlays
